Load INIT program and STDLIB from reserved area on disk. This module contains a very rudimentary ATFS driver to do that. It is kind of a hack to avoid a chicken-\/egg problem because we want the filesystem driver to be in userspace but we can\textquotesingle{}t load the FS driver without already having an FS driver.
